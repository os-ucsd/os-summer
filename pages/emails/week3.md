Welcome to Open Source Summer Week 3!

## Week 2 Spotlight üåû

Last week, we received some awesome proposals to our Open Source Arcade/Casino repository! 

Here are some cool game proposals you all made üòé

- "Grade or No Grade" from [@AlvinNgo123](https://github.com/AlvinNgo123)  
- "Word Chain" from [@kchang264 ](https://github.com/kchang264 ) 
- " Flappy Raccoon" from [@Viviaann](https://github.com/Viviaann) 



View all of the game proposals [here](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22SEAL+of+approval%22+)!


## Week 3 Overview

Last week, we introduced Issues and had you all submit issues to propose game ideas to contribute to our Open Source Arcade/Casino. 
This week, you‚Äôll claim your game as yours, and begin implementing the ideas that you proposed!


### Claiming Issues ‚ùó

Sometimes, maintainers in open source projects don't have time to work on every single feature request or bug fix.
So, maintainers typically rely on individual contributors from the open source community to step in and claim tasks to make the project better.


Here are some examples of this in action:

- [City-Bureau/city-scrapers](https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers), a repository of web scrapers for local governments, has several issues where maintainers are [asking for help](https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers/labels/help%20wanted) for various tasks
- [zeit/next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), a React framework in JavaScript, has issues that are [asking for help](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/labels/help%20wanted) on a wide variety of topics
- [dtcrout/spotitude](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude/issues), a Spotify user analytics visualizer written in Python, [asks for help](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude/issues) with some new features

## Weekly Challenge #3 - Claimin' üôã and Buildin' üõ†

This week, there are 2 parts to our challenge: 



### Part 1: Claim your game's issue!

If your proposal from last week's challenge got the SEAL of approval, we will be closing the issue that you created with your proposal. 
Then, we will create a ** new ** issue that 
will have a  <HelpWantedLabel/>
      label, asking for someone (you!) to actually implement (code) the new game.

**Your job** is to comment on that new issue, saying that you would like to implement the game! This is you "claiming" that issue. Once you've claimed it, we will add you as a collaborator to the repository and assign the issue to you. 

For example, on [@chrisjrobles](https://github.com/chrisjrobles)'s proposal to add Sneküêç to our casino ([Issue #1](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues/1)),
Chris got the SEAL of approval, so we closed that issue and created a new issue, [Issue #6](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues/6), that has the <HelpWantedLabel/> label.
Chris now will comment on this new Issue #6, saying something like "I'll take this issue!". 

Once we get his comment, we will [assign the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)
to Chris and he will be done with Part 1!


### Part 2: Work on your game!

This part is self explanatory - begin working on your game! 
Install any programming languages you might need, figure out your developer enviroment, write your first lines of code. Don't worry about pushing your code to Github or forking the casino repository quite yet, we will get to that next week! 

As always, if you have problems with your code, get stuck, can't figure out an error, or you don't know how to begin, feel free to post on our FB group, discord channel, or create an issue on Github! We've got a team of people we will work with you on any problems you may have. Links below!
