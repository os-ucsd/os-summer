Welcome to Open Source Summer Week 4!


### Gists - Snippets of code, documentation, or text üìú

Github offers a service called [Gists](https://gist.github.com/) - which are mini-repositories of snippets of text. In the open source community, people use a gists as a way to share snippets of code that may not be large enough to be its own repo. 


Take a look at [the most recently created Gists](https://gist.github.com/discover) - you'll see a ton of people using gists to store small code snippets, instructions, or small datasets. You can ‚≠êstar, üí¨ comment, or even üç¥ fork a gist. Gists are stored as git repostories - meaning you have a full history and collaboration abilities for all your gists!

Gitlab, a service similar to Github, also has [Snippets](https://gitlab.com/explore/snippets), which work in a very similar way. Pastebin is also another similar service, but with a Gist, you can store any type of file (text, code, pictures, compressed files, etc.).


#### When should I use a gist?

If you have a larger project that you want other people to contribute to, or a project that you want to show off to people, don't use a gist, use a normal Github repo! Gists are meant for small, 1-5 file tasks. Here are some scenarios where this might come up:

- üêç You're teaching a friend how to use a python scraping library, and you want to send a small python file as an example 
- ‚ùå Your code is throwing an error, and there's a large stack trace you want to share with someone to get help 
- üì¢ You took some notes at a cool tech talk, and you want to share them with people who couldn't go

#### Examples of gists in action

- @caseywatts's [guide on to how to make bookmarklets with JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/c0cec1f89ccdb8b469b1)
- @robotslave's [instructions on "How to get Emoji in your Ubuntu Terminal"](https://gist.github.com/robotslave/4633393)

## Weekly Mini-Challenge #4 - Show off your progress in your game!

Last week, you claimed an issue to work on a game in our [open source casino](http://github.com/os-ucsd/casino) - and you've been making progress implementing it!

Now, you get to show off your work! You don't need to have your entire game finished yet - that'll be next week. We just want to see one cool snippet of code from anywhere in your project!

To complete this challenge officially, follow these steps:

1. [Create a new Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with a snippet that you want to show off. If it's an entire file, drag the file onto the page to upload. If it's a snippet of code, just copy+paste it into the text box.
2. Choose `Create a secret gist` - this makes it so your gist won't appear in the public feed, but you'll still be able to share a link. Save the link!
3. Find the issue that you claimed in last week's challenge - it should appear [in this list](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%9A%A7+In+progress%22).
4. On that issue, leave a comment saying that you're making progress, and share a link to the gist you made!



### Choosing your snippet ü§î


The snippet you share can be anything - a function you spent some time figuring out, skeleton code for an important class, or even some documentation that you wrote on how to compile your code. Literally any snippet of anything you wrote will work!

Your snippet doesn't have to be the entire file either - if it makes sense to just copy+paste a function or a few lines of code, that's completely fine!

If you feel that your snippet of code isn't "enough", it totally is! whether it's a `System.out.println("Hello World")`, a complicated algorithm, or just a few paragraphs explaining the game, we'd love to see it!
