Welcome to Open Source Summer Week 5!


## Popsicle Break! üç®

It's almost halfway through the summer, so this week will have our first Popsicle Break! 

Popsicle Breaks are just a time for you to not worry about any new topics or mini-challenges, but instead spend some time finishing up any previous challenges that you haven't taken on yet!

Like always, you can always finish these challenges at any time, at your own pace. But if you've procrastinated a bit and feel 1 challenge per week is overwhelming, use this break to spend some time catching up!
