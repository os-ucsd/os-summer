# Open Source Summer - Mini Challenges Notes

If you're maintaining an Open Source Summer program, here are some tips+templates for how to maintain the weekly mini-challenge contributions.

## Actually Sending the Emails

0. Have access to the OS@UCSD Google Drive
1. Open the [Mailing List](docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10cRdrHpfORLCRMYl4TH2U-CpnTNZQGu4xeAhIZXik1g)
2. Copy all the emails on the `Email üìß` column
3. **IMPORTANT** - paste the emails as **Bcc** recipients - super important! This is to avoid "Reply All" nightmares.
4. Put a link to the email, ideally from the `os-ucsd-summer.glitch.me` app
5. Send it!

### When Week 3 starts - on SEAL approved proposals

#### 1. [Create new issue](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues/new/choose) that contributor must claim

```
Based on the proposal found at #ORIG_ISSUE, we want to add {{GAME_NAME}} to our casino!

If you'd like to be the one to implement this game, please comment on this issue!

[Note: Only comment below if you were the original person to make the proposal]
```

#### 2. Comment on original issue describing next steps


```
Hey @username!

Now that your proposal got the SEAL of approval, I'll be closing this issue since it's now complete!

For our Open Source Summer Challenge for Week 3, we are creating a new issue (#ISSUE_NUM) that will track the actual implementation (coding, documentation, testing, etc.) of the game. This issue you made was just for proposing your game, so it has served its purpose. Now, to claim the new issue, please go to Issue #ISSUE_NUM, and comment saying that you'll be implementing {{GAME_NAME}}! 

Once we get your comment, we will assign that issue to you.

Let me know if you have any questions, or if any parts of this are confusing!

```

#### 3. Close original issue

### When someone claims their issue

#### 1. Create a README in [`games/new-game-name/README.md`](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/new/master/games?filename=games/new-game-name/README.md)


```
# New Game Name
  
TODO - Fill out README (future Open Source Summer mini-challenge) 
```

#### 2. [Edit base README](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/edit/master/README.md), add new entry in Games table

```
|[New Game Name](games/new-game-name)|[Example](https://github.com/Example)|[#ISSUE_NUM](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/issues/ISSUE_NUM)|üöß In Progress

```

#### 3. Assign the contributor to the issue

#### 4. Remove `help wanted` label, add `üöß In Progress` label

#### 5. Add the issue to the `Open Source Summer 2019` milestone 

#### 6. Comment on the issue letting the contributor know what's up

Note: Make it personal if you can!


```
Thanks for claiming this, @username!  You are now assigned to this issue, and your game is listed as `In Progress` in our [README](https://github.com/os-ucsd/casino/blob/master/README.md#games).


Feel free to work on your game in your own way! Next week, we'll have more info on how to make a Pull Request to add your game. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to post in our FB group, discord channel, or create a new issue in this repo!
